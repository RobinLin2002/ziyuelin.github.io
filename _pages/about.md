<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I received my B.S. from The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen. I am currently pursuing a master's degree in the Department of Mathematics at The University of Hong Kong, with a major in Artificial Intelligence. **I am currently seeking PhD positions for 2026 Fall.**

My research interests include computer vision, image restoration, and interpretability in AI. This is my personal CV: [Ziyue Lin's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/林子越_个人中英文简历.pdf)

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Qu](https://liangqiong.github.io/) from [School of Computing and Data Science](https://www.cds.hku.hk/), The University of Hong Kong.
